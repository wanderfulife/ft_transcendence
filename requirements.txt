Chapter II
Objectives
This project is a surprise.
As you are reaching the end of your Common Core, you have developed strong adap-
tation and problem-solving skills. This project will confront you with -maybe- unknown
technologies, intentionally. Once again, you will have to adapt, discover, explore, exper-
iment to create the expected software.
The project includes a mandatory part and a series of modules on various topics, as
detailed below in this subject. You will be able to choose the modules you want among
a large list, but each module and mandatory element contains technical constraints you
cannot bypass. So you can select the topics you like, but not technologies you like. This
is a deliberate pedagogical choice.
This project is not intended to be a portfolio for an incoming internship or other pro-
fessional experience. Its purpose is to reveal your ability to become acquainted with and
complete a complex task using an unfamiliar technology. This situation will inevitably
be faced during your career, and we aim to develop your self-confidence in front of such
situations.
Especially on this big and long project, we encourage you to carefully read the en-
tire subject, consider several possible strategies, think about your design, before starting
coding anything! Some modules may depend on others, some modules may conflict with
others. Ft_transcendence will bring many doubts and requires a lot of difficult decisions!
Act wisely :-)
Also, this project is definitely a long run, and a wrong path will lead you to a huge loss
of time. Your project management and team management choices will strongly impact
yourtimelineandresults. Manyapproachesandtoolsexisttosupportyouonthesetopics.
Good luck, and have fun playing Pong!

Chapter III
AI Instructions
● Context
During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different tasks. Take the time to
explore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support your work. How-
ever, always approach them with caution and critically assess the results. Whether it’s
code, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations, you can never be completely sure
that your question was well-formed or that the generated content is accurate. Your peers
are a valuable resource to help you avoid mistakes and blind spots.
● Main message
☛ Use AI to reduce repetitive or tedious tasks.
☛ Develop prompting skills — both coding and non-coding — that will benefit your
future career.
☛ Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases,
and ethical issues.
☛ Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
☛ Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibility
for.
● Learner rules:
• You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, so
you can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
• You should reflect on your problem before prompting — this helps you write clearer,
more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
• You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing, questioning,
and testing anything generated by AI.
• You should always seek peer review — don’t rely solely on your own validation.
4
ft_transcendence Surprise.
● Phase outcomes:
• Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
• Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
• Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and
collaboration.
● Comments and examples:
• You’ll regularly encounter situations — exams, evaluations, and more — where
you must demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both your
technical and interpersonal skills.
• Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your un-
derstanding. Make peer learning a priority.
• AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic responses. Your
peers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and accurate insights.
• Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide alter-
native perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality checkpoint.
✓ Good practice:
I ask AI: “How do I test a sorting function?” It gives me a few ideas. I try them out
and review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.
✗ Bad practice:
I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project. During peer-
evaluation, I can’t explain what it does or why. I lose credibility — and I fail my
project.
✓ Good practice:
I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catch
two bugs and rewrite it together — better, cleaner, and fully understood.
✗ Bad practice:
I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can’t
explain how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail my
project.

Chapter IV
Mandatory part
This project is about creating a website for the mightyPong contest!
IV.1 Overview
Yoursoftwarewillofferaniceuserinterfaceandreal-timemultiplayercapabilitiesallowing
to play Pong with all your friends!
• At first, your project needs to adhere to the mandatory guidelines as a minimum
requirement (see next section), which will represent only a small portion to the final
grade.
• The second part of this subject will offer additional modules that can replace or
complement the mandatory part.
In this subject, you will face words that are highlighted in green. They represent
technology choices that will evolve over time. Be sure to pay close attention to the
version of the subject.
• The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or a module is
prohibited.
• Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
• The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple, unique
task representing a subcomponent of a larger feature or module,
is allowed.
• During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project
guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project’s
constraints.
• During the evaluation, the evaluator will take responsibility
for determining whether the use of a specific library or tool
is legitimate (and allowed) or if it essentially solves an
entire feature or module (and is therefore prohibited).

ft_transcendence Surprise.
IV.2 Minimal technical requirement
Your project must comply with the following rules:
Some of these constraints may be overridden by the choice of specific
modules.
• You are free to develop the site, with or without a backend.
◦ If you choose to include a backend, it must be written in purePHP without
frameworks. However, this requirement can be overridden by theFramework
module.
◦ If your backend or framework uses a database, you must follow the constraints
of theDatabase module.
• The frontend should be developed usingTypescript as base code. However, this
requirement can be modified through theFrontEnd module.
• Your website must be a single-page application. The user should be able to use the
Back and Forward buttons of the browser.
• Your website must be compatible with thelatest stable up-to-date versionof
Mozilla Firefox . Of course, it can be compatible with other web browsers!
• The user should encounter no unhandled errors or warnings when browsing the
website.
• You must use Docker to run your website. Everything must be launched with a
single command line to run an autonomous container.
Several container technologies exist: Docker, containerd, podman,
etc. On the computers of your campus, you may access the container
software in rootless mode for security reasons. This could lead to
the following extra constraints:
• Your runtime needs to be located in /goinfre or /sgoinfre.
• You are not able to use “bind-mount volumes” between the host
and the container if non-root UIDs are used in the container.
Depending on the current requirements of the subject (highlighted in
green above) and the local configuration in clusters, you may need to
adopt different strategies, such as: container solution in virtual
machine, rebuild your container after your changes, craft your own
image with root as unique UID.

IV.3 Game
The main purpose of this website is to play Pong versus other players.
• Users must be able to participate in a live Pong game against another player directly
on the website. Both players will use the same keyboard. TheRemote players
module can enhance this functionality with remote players.
• A player must be able to play against another, and atournament system should
also be available. This tournament will consist of multiple players who can take
turns playing against each other. You have flexibility in how you implement the
tournament, but it must clearly display who is playing against whom and the order
of the play.
• A registration systemis required: at the start of a tournament, each player must
input their alias. The aliases will be reset when a new tournament begins. How-
ever, this requirement can be modified using theStandard User Management
module. Note: This doesnot imply user account creation.
In the default (mandatory) version, users simply enter an alias manually.
• There must be amatchmaking system: the tournament system should organize
the matchmaking of the participants, and announce the next match.
• All players must adhere to the same rules, including having identical paddle speed.
This requirement also applies when using AI; the AI must exhibit the same speed
as a regular player.
• The game must adhere to the default frontend constraints (as outlined above), or
you may choose to use theFrontEnd module, or override it with theGraphics
module. While the visual aesthetics can vary, the game must still capture the
essence of theoriginal Pong(1972).
8
ft_transcendence Surprise.
• The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or module is
prohibited.
• Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
• The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple,
unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature
or module, is allowed.
• During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of a
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project
guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project’s
constraints.
• During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the
use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed)
or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is
therefore prohibited).
• The tournament system must work with or without user
registration.
◦ Without the Standard User Management module: users
manually input an alias.
◦ With the module: aliases are linked to registered
accounts, allowing persistent stats and friend lists.
The module extends the tournament logic; it does not replace
it.

IV.4 Security concerns
In order to create a functional website, there are several security concerns you must
address:
• Any password stored in your database, if applicable, must behashed.
• Your website must be protected againstSQL injections/XSS attacks.
• If you have a backend or any other features, it is mandatory to enable an HTTPS
connection for all aspects (use wss instead of ws for example).
• You must implement validation mechanisms for forms and any user input, either on
the base page if no backend is used, or on the server side if a backend is employed.
• Regardless of whether you choose to implement the JWT Security module with
2FA, it’s essential to prioritize the security of your website. For instance, if you
choose to create an API, ensure your routes are protected. Even if you decide not
to use JWT tokens, securing the site remains critical.
Please make sure you use a strong password hashing algorithm
For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env
variables etc., must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored
by git. Publicly stored credentials will cause your project to fail.

Chapter V
Modules
Now that you’ve accomplished 25% of the project, congratulations!
With a functional basic website in place, the next step is to choose modules for fur-
ther improvement.
To achieve 100% project completion, a minimum of7 major modules is required.
It’s crucial to carefully review each module as it may require modifications to your base-
line website. Therefore, we strongly recommend reading this entire subject thoroughly.
• The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or module is
prohibited.
• Any direct instructions regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
• The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple,
unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature
or module, is allowed.
• During the evaluation, the team will justify any usage of
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the subject,
and that does not contradict the subject’s constraints.
• During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the
use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed)
or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is
therefore prohibited).

These modules enable the integration of advanced web features into your Pong game.
• Major module: Use a framework to build the backend.
In this major module, you are required to use a specific web framework for backend
development: Fastify with Node.js .
You can create the backend without using the constraints of this
module by using the default backend language (as specified above in
the mandatory part). However, this module will only be valid if you
follow its requirements.
• Minor module: Use a framework or toolkit to build the front-end.
Your frontend development must use theTailwind CSS in addition of the Type-
script, and nothing else.
You can create a front-end without using the constraints of this
module by using the default front-end directives (as specified above
in the mandatory part). However, this module will only be valid if
you follow its requirements.
• Minor module: Use a database for the backend -and more.
The designated database for all DB instances in your project isSQLite This choice
ensure data consistency and compatibility across all project components and may
be a prerequisite for other modules, such as thebackend Framework module.
• Major module: Store the score of a tournament in the Blockchain.
This Major module focuses on implementing a feature within the Pong website to
securely store tournament scores on a blockchain. It is essential to clarify that for
development and testing purposes, we will use a testing blockchain environment.
The chosen blockchain for this implementation isAvalanche , andSolidity will be
the programming language used for smart contract development.
◦ Blockchain Integration: The primary goal of this module is to seamlessly in-
tegrate blockchain technology, specificallyAvalache , into the Pong website.
This integration ensures the secure and immutable storage of tournament
scores, providing players with a transparent and tamper-proof record of their
gaming achievements.
◦ Solidity Smart Contracts: To interact with the blockchain, we will develop
Solidity smart contracts. These contracts will be responsible for recording,
managing, and retrieving tournament scores.

separated computer, accessing the same website and playing the same Pong game.
Consider network issues, such as unexpected disconnections or lag.
You must offer the best user experience possible.
• Major module: Multiple players
It should be possible to have more than two players. Each player needs live control
(so the “remote players” module is strongly recommended). It’s up to you to decide
how the game could be played with 3, 4, 5, 6 or more players. Along with the regular
2 players game, you can define a specific number of players, greater than 2, for this
multiplayer module. Ex: 4 players could play on a square board, with each player
controlling one unique side of the square.
• Major module: Add another game with user history and matchmaking.
The goal of this major module, is to introduce a new game, distinct from Pong, and
incorporate features such as user history tracking and matchmaking. Key features

Chapter VII
Submission and peer-evaluation
Submit your assignment in yourGit repository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the defense. You are encouraged to double-check the
names of your files to ensure they are correct.
• The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or a module is
prohibited.
• Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
• The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple, unique
task representing a subcomponent of a larger feature or module
is allowed.
• During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of a
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the subject
and is not contradicting with the subject’s constraints.
• During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the
use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed)
or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is
therefore prohibited).
During the evaluation, a briefmodification of the projectmay occasionally be re-
quested. This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or
rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
While this step maynot be applicable to every project, you must be prepared for it
if it is mentioned in the evaluation guidelines.
This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g.,
your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes — unless a specific
timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation.
You can, for example, be asked to make a small update to a function or script, modify a
display, or adjust a data structure to store new information, etc.
